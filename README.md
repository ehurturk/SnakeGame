# SnakeGame

Snake Game

This project was done in Python 3, using Turtle graphics. This is the basic snake game that probably all of you played before. 

In any case, here are the instructions (All of the directions here are all relative to us!):

UP Key - Changes the snake direction to upwards

DOWN Key - Changes the snake direction to downwards

LEFT Key - Changes the snake direction to left

RIGHT Key - Changes the snake direction to right

Aim: Your aim is to increase the length of your snake by eating randomized foods and avoiding colliding with yourself or borders.

To run the game, you need to download the codes and type `python3 main.py` into your terminal.

Have Fun!
